Note that I am just a single programmer, so I don't have the resources for lots of testing. There will likely be bugs at this stage. Any feedback or bug reports would be greatly appreciated. You can leave feedback via the contact page on the above website or creating an issue on the repository.

I will allow people to view and collaborate on code (as I'm sure there are many improvements that could be made). I will review pull requests. I do not allow people to distribute projects using my code.
